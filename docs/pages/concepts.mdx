# Why "Submodule"?

It is very high chance (like 99% chances), you have used libraries/framework for your project within JS ecosystem. You'll start with an example from library's documentation, try it out, happy and apply

Things that you may not be fully aware of is, the code you copy from those example, are not "production-ready". It maybe a little bit too fancy to say "production-ready", but,

- **The code may not be readable**
- **The code may not clear of dependencies**
- **The code may not be explicit for operations (port binding, external configs)**
- **The code may behave differently on each desired environment (dev, staging, production, clustering)**

Does those sound good to you? Then there are few more reasons you may want to read further
- **The code may not be composable (don't be extreme, you don't need it all the time)**
- **The code may not be testable**
- **The code may not be reusable**

### Fact

The code below copied from [fastify homepage](https://fastify.dev/)

```typescript
import Fastify, { FastifyInstance, RouteShorthandOptions } from 'fastify'
import { Server, IncomingMessage, ServerResponse } from 'http'

const server: FastifyInstance = Fastify({})

const opts: RouteShorthandOptions = {
  schema: {
    response: {
      200: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          pong: {
            type: 'string'
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

server.get('/ping', opts, async (request, reply) => {
  return { pong: 'it worked!' }
})

const start = async () => {
  try {
    await server.listen({ port: 3000 })

    const address = server.server.address()
    const port = typeof address === 'string' ? address : address?.port

  } catch (err) {
    server.log.error(err)
    process.exit(1)
  }
}

start()
```

To get this code to a little bit more production-use
- The server will need to be configurable
- The listening part will need to be configurable
- The configuration should be testable across different environments (well, those configuration maybe changed)

We can manage it by
```typescript
import Fastify, { FastifyInstance, RouteShorthandOptions } from 'fastify'
import { Server, IncomingMessage, ServerResponse } from 'http'

type FastifyConfig = { /** config type */ }
function createFastifyServer(config: FastifyConfig = {}): FastifyInstance {
  return Fastify(config)
}

type FastifyListeningConfig = { /** config type */}
async function startFastifyServer(server: FastifyInstance, config: FastifyListeningConfig) {
  try {
    await server.listen({ port: 3000 })

    const address = server.server.address()
    const port = typeof address === 'string' ? address : address?.port

  } catch (err) {
    server.log.error(err)
    process.exit(1)
  }
}

function loadAndValidateConfig() {
  // this where you may want to retrieve and validate configuration from process.env or argv
  return {
    fastify: {
      server: { /**... */},
      listening: { /**... */}
    }
  }
}

function registerRoutes(server: FastifyInstance) {
  const opts: RouteShorthandOptions = {
    schema: {
      response: {
        200: {
          type: 'object',
          properties: {
            pong: {
              type: 'string'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  server.get('/ping', opts, async (request, reply) => {
    return { pong: 'it worked!' }
  })
}

const start = async () => {
  const { fastify } = loadAndValidateConfig()
  const server = createFastifyServer(fastify.server)
  registerRoutes(server)
  await startFastifyServer(server, fastify.listening)
}

start()
```

The code is more concrete, more testable, but we get to see the dependencies building up quite quickly and it brings more complexity to `start` function, as it is the starting point of them all.

# Concepts

Submodule is built around a function first-class support. It utilizes nature of functions to
- Share configuration, services
- Caching
- Composition

As such, submodule can be used to reuse configuration, functionality, group of services, group of codes. As they are all functions, they encourage testability and reusability
